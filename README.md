# Data Visualization with Plotnine
This repository contains my contributions to UConn's Introduction to Data Science (STAT 3255) classnotes, specifically focusing on Data Visualization with Plotnine.

Data visualization is an incredibly important skill to possess as a data scientist. Being able to convey findings to individuals in a non-technical background ensures that your insights are understood and useful, helping to bridge the gap between data analysis and decision-making.

This class note contribution focuses on Plotnine, a Python library for creating visually appealing and effective visualizations. It includes examples and explanations of the various ways to customize visualizations, making them both user-friendly and informative. These resources are designed to help students develop skills they can apply in their careers, whether in corporate settings or academia. 

These notes were presented to the Dr. Jun Yan's Fall 2024 Introduction to Data Science class.
